This the readme for compiling Tangible Scores.

This repository of code has been written for Processing 2.2.1. It wonÂ´t run under Processing 3.

1) Open the TangibleScores.pde sketch and include all the other pde files as tabs in your project. 
2) You need the following Processing libraries: controlP5, oscP5, netP5. The rest are java native libs.
